# Team Topologies Visualizer - Backlog

This is the public backlog for ideas, priorities, and possible improvements.

**Status**: Pre-release v1.0 development  
**Last updated**: 2026-01-24

## How to use this backlog

- **Now**: what I personally want to prioritize next (short list)
- **Next**: good candidates after the Now list
- **Later / Maybe**: longer-term ideas and experiments
- For contribution ideas, look for items that are small, well-scoped, and testable.

**Context note**: The tool defaults to "TT Design" view. The other view is "Pre-TT" (previously "Current State") and represents the baseline/starting point before TT transformation.

## Now (top priorities)

Edit this list as your priorities change:

- Flow metrics: Phase 3 value stream aggregation (show aggregated metrics on groupings)
- Model robustness: reduce brittle name-based references (IDs, validation, clearer errors)
- Data modeling: keep narrative text separate from resolvable dependency targets
- UX/visual clarity improvements (reduce clutter, better defaults, better affordances)
- Documentation: keep setup + modeling guides short and drift-resistant

## Next

- Refactor frontend file structure into subfolders (DX improvement)
- Config-driven ordering/completeness in baseline perspectives (products/business streams)
- Import/export tooling for easier onboarding (CSV/JSON helpers)

## Later / Maybe

- “Virtual nodes” / constraint cards (e.g., release gates, compliance constraints)
- More platform-as-a-product indicators (maturity, adoption funnel, pain points)
- Diff-style views for snapshots (beyond side-by-side)

## Detailed backlog (legacy)

Most of the content that used to live here was historical implementation detail and completed work. To keep this backlog actionable and contributor-friendly, those sections have been removed.

- For completed work, use [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).
- For current work, treat **Now / Next / Later** above as the source of truth.
