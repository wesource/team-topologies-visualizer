# Customer Support Department

First-line customer support, incident management, and customer success for all LogiCore products.

## Department Goals
- 🎯 Minimize customer complaints and escalations
- 🎯 Fast response times and resolution (SLA compliance)
- 🎯 System stability - NO CHANGES!
- 🎯 Zero critical incidents
- 🎯 High customer satisfaction scores

## Priorities
- Stability over everything
- Bug fixes immediately
- No risky releases
- Maintain uptime at all costs
- Quick hotfixes for customer issues

## Operating Reality
- Overwhelmed with tickets from customer-specific customizations
- Difficulty supporting multiple product versions and custom branches
- Pressure to "just make it work" without understanding root cause
- Advocates for change freezes and extended testing periods

## Typical Conflicts With Other Departments
- **vs Engineering**: "Stop deploying changes, everything was working fine!"
- **vs Customer Solutions**: "Your customizations are breaking everything!"
- **vs Product Management**: "We can't support more features, fix the bugs first!"
