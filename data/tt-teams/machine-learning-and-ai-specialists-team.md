# Machine Learning & AI Specialists Team

## Team name and focus

Machine Learning & AI Specialists Team - A complicated-subsystem team responsible for developing and maintaining machine learning models and AI capabilities that require deep specialized knowledge in data science, ML engineering, and advanced analytics.

## Team type

complicated-subsystem

**Why complicated-subsystem?** This team exists because ML/AI work requires deep technical expertise (data science, model training, feature engineering, model deployment, monitoring for drift) that would create excessive cognitive load for stream-aligned teams. The complexity justifies a specialized team.

## Services provided (if applicable)

- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics and forecasting
- Technical guidance on AI/ML best practices

## Service-level expectations (SLA)
- Model API uptime: 99.9%
- Model update frequency: Monthly or as needed
- Support requests: Response within 1 business day

## Software owned and evolved by this team
- Model training pipelines (Kubeflow, MLflow)
- Model serving APIs (FastAPI, TensorFlow Serving)
- Feature stores
- A/B testing platform for ML

## Versioning approaches
- Semantic versioning for model APIs and artifacts
- Breaking changes announced 2 weeks in advance

## Wiki and documentation
- [Team Wiki](https://wiki.company.com/teams/ml-specialists)
- [API Docs](https://docs.company.com/ml-specialists)

## Glossary and terms ubiquitous language
- **AUC**: Area Under the Curve (model accuracy metric)
- **Feature engineering**: Creating input variables for ML models
- **Model drift**: Degradation of model performance over time

## Communication
- **Chat**: #ml-specialists
- **Email**: ml-specialists@company.com
