# Security Compliance Team

Enabling team helping other teams adopt security best practices and meet compliance requirements.

## Team Type: Enabling Team
This is an **Enabling Team** because:
- Helps other teams overcome obstacles and build new capabilities
- Temporary, time-boxed engagements (not permanent dependencies)
- Focus on upskilling and enabling, not on doing the work for teams
- Moves from team to team as needed

## Cognitive Load Assessment
- **Overall**: Medium (appropriate for enabling work)
- **Breadth over depth**: Broad knowledge across security domains to help many teams

## Responsibilities
- Security best practices guidance
- Compliance support (PCI, GDPR, SOC2)
- Security training and workshops
- Threat modeling facilitation
- Security tool selection and adoption
- Vulnerability assessment guidance

## Current Engagements (Facilitation Mode)

### 1. Payment Platform Team (Active - 3 months)
**Objective**: Support new PCI DSS 4.0 requirements
**Activities**:
- Facilitate threat modeling sessions
- Review security architecture
- Help team understand new compliance requirements
- Transfer knowledge so team can self-serve in future

**Success criteria**: Team can maintain PCI compliance independently

### 2. Upcoming: Mobile Platform & Mobile App Teams
**Objective**: Improve mobile security posture
**Planned activities**:
- Mobile security workshop
- Code signing and certificate management
- Secure storage practices
- API security for mobile

## Enabling Team Principles

### Time-Boxed Engagements
- Typical engagement: 2-4 months
- Goal is to enable, then move on
- Team should be able to continue without us

### Knowledge Transfer Focus
- Pair programming and shadowing
- Documentation and playbooks
- Training sessions
- "Teach how to fish" approach

### Detect Missing Capabilities
- Regularly assess teams for security gaps
- Proactive outreach to teams
- Sense where enabling is needed most

## Technologies & Tools
- Security scanning tools (Snyk, SonarQube)
- Threat modeling frameworks (STRIDE)
- Compliance frameworks (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC2)
- Cloud security (AWS Security Hub, Azure Security Center)

## Team Composition
- 1 Security Architect / Lead
- 1 Security Engineer (cloud security specialist)
- 1 Compliance Specialist

## Success Metrics
- Number of teams enabled: 6 teams in last 12 months
- Team self-sufficiency after engagement: 90%
- Security incident reduction: -40% in enabled teams
- Teams requesting repeat engagements: 10% (target: < 20%)
  - Lower is better - means teams learned well!

## Queue of Future Engagements
1. Mobile security (Q1 2026)
2. Data Engineering Team - data privacy and GDPR (Q2 2026)
3. Enterprise Sales Portal - SOC2 audit prep (Q2 2026)

## Not an Enabling Team If...
We would know we're failing as an enabling team if:
- ❌ Teams become dependent on us (we become a bottleneck)
- ❌ We do the work instead of enabling teams to do it
- ❌ Engagements never end
- ❌ We build tools instead of enabling teams to choose and use tools
