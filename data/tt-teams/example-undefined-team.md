# Example Undefined Team

This is an example of an undefined team - a team that has not yet been designed into one of the 4 fundamental Team Topologies team types.

**Usage**: Use this team type during Team Topologies transformation planning to mark teams that still need design decisions about their fundamental type (stream-aligned, platform, enabling, or complicated-subsystem).

**Note**: The dashed border indicates "not yet defined" status. As transformation progresses, teams should be moved from undefined to one of the 4 fundamental types.
