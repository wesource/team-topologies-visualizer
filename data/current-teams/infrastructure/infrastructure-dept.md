# Infrastructure & Operations Department

IT operations, hosting, security, and infrastructure management for all LogiTech systems and services.

## Department Goals
- 🔒 Security and compliance (SOC2, GDPR, etc.)
- 🔒 Cost optimization (reduce cloud spend)
- 🔒 System reliability and uptime
- 🔒 Change control and risk mitigation
- 🔒 Standardization and governance

## Priorities
- Security audits and compliance requirements
- Cost reduction and budget constraints
- Strict change management processes
- Infrastructure standardization
- Backup and disaster recovery

## Operating Reality
- Lengthy approval processes for infrastructure changes
- Focus on cost containment over innovation
- Risk-averse decision making
- Heavy process and documentation requirements
- Friction with development teams wanting cloud resources

## Typical Conflicts With Other Departments
- **vs Engineering**: "You can't just spin up new cloud resources, submit a request!"
- **vs Customer Solutions**: "Each custom deployment is a security nightmare!"
- **vs Product Management**: "We need 6 weeks for security review before any release"
