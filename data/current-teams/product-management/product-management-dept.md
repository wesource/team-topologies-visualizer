# Product Management Department

Portfolio management, product strategy, and roadmap prioritization across all FleetFlow products. Acts as the bridge between business strategy and execution.

## Department Goals
- 📊 Maximize feature output across all products
- 📊 Prioritize high-value customer requests
- 📊 Balance multiple stakeholder demands
- 📊 Hit quarterly OKRs and commitments
- 📊 Minimize development costs

## Priorities
- More features delivered faster
- Customer feature requests (especially large accounts)
- Sales commitments and deadlines
- Competitive feature parity
- Quarterly targets and metrics

## Typical Behavior
- Create detailed roadmaps with aggressive timelines
- Promise features to sales before engineering estimates
- Prioritize everything as "critical" or "high priority"
- Frequent reprioritization and context switching
- Push for "quick wins" and MVPs

## Typical Conflicts With Other Departments
- **vs Engineering**: "Why is this taking so long? Can't you just add it quickly?"
- **vs Customer Solutions**: "Stop building one-off customizations, wait for the roadmap!"
- **vs Architecture**: "We don't have time for architectural reviews, customers are waiting"

## Operating Reality
Functions as both product management and portfolio management, leading to conflicting priorities and overcommitment.
